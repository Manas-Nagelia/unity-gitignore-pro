# unity-gitignorePro
This is the ultimate .gitignore for Unity users. The default .gitignore that GitHub provides for Unity is great, but this .gitignore include stuff like .fbx, .blend, etc files. This can be very useful. Also, this .gitignore contains OS specific items, for example, on OSX (Macs), you don't want to commit .DS_Store changes. This simple .gitignore for Unity solves it all.
